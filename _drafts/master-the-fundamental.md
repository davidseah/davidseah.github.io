Recently I have been playing around with programming questions from Leetcode. I realized that my programming skills have kinda become worse. Especially my algorithm and data structure skills. I think I kinda regret not spending time to just master algorithm programming. I think it is a good skill to have, it gives you a set of tools to solve problems. But I believe that nothing is ever too late. I have started ramping up practising algorithm problem-solving. 

One thing that I get now is the frustration when I am not able to solve a problem. I think this is very normal for a beginner given the lack of having a set of tools or ideas on how to approach a problem. I believe that as long as I keep doing this I will eventually get better. Also, I think it is important to treat it as a form of challenge, maybe like some kind of game. Instead of focusing on getting the question correct, I will focus more on the problem-solving aspect. The thinking process and solving the question logically, with the breakdown of my thoughts in a clear manner. Instead of just trial and error, which really will not improve my skills. 

Most important is to stay relaxed even if I am stuck and have a positive attitude about. I will be better by next year if I stay consistent solving problems every day.
