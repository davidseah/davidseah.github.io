I have a khronos FTF meeting 3 weeks from now. 
One of the topics will be on Vulkan which is most relevant to me.
But the issue is that I do not know anything about Vulkan.

I always wanted to learn it but found no time or motivation.
So this is the perfect opportunity to learn it. 
I will try to document my journey over here.

# Strategy
1. Finish all the exercise in https://vulkan-tutorial.com/
2. Read Vulkan Programming Guide: The Official Guide to Learning Vulkan
3. Build a graphics engine using Vulkan
