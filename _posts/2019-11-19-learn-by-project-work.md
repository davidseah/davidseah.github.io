Just watched TechLead sharing about how he learned programming, which is to do it by working on projects. Many people including myself learn a programming language without having an aim. Usually, if you apply what you learn to something, you forget about it. Also, working on a project, you can add it to your resume. 

So in short, start by thinking about a project that you want to work instead of just learning something for the stake of learning.
