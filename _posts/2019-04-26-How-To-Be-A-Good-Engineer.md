I read an article last week on how to be a good engineer which I find it really true.

## Curiosity
Curiosity allows one to dive into things. To find out what one does not know. Is curiosity inborn or something that we can train to be? I am not so sure about it. I mean there other things that I will be interested in and not. While some other people will find some other stuff interesting that I will find it totally boring. But is it possible to have an interest in everything and if that can be cultivated? I am not sure. But I will keep a lookout for answers.

## Communication
Communication is to spread what you know to people. This is getting more and more important as we are building bigger and bigger things that need major collaboration. I must admit that I am not very good at communication. Something which I am trying to improve myself on. Both written and in speech. So that is what this blog was created. Practising to be better in this aspect.
