For the longest time, I have been finding out what is the best way to manage my knowledge. I think the key in this information age where information is abundant, we need a system to organise information and knowledge. I tried using google docs, GitHub with markdown notes and even physical notebooks. But none seems to works. 

Recently I found out about Gitbook, which works like a wiki. I thought that this is perfect. The way it is structured is perfect for my needs. Information is usually none linear, that is why notebooks and word document are not that useful. Also, I have a tendency to work on multiple topics at a time. I switch from things to things. So it is important to have a system where I can easily move from one topic to the other. 

Anyway, I have link the wiki up on one of the links. I will slowly fill it up. Maybe take some time to think about how I will organise it.
