I am not really sure who reads this blog. My original intention of having this blog is to write down things that I have learned. But I realise that it is not so easy. The barrier is just too high. I feared my writing will not be good enough. 

I think to use this blog as a showcase of my skills is not such a good idea. 
So now I want to change the focus of this blog to simply enjoying the process of documenting things that I have learned. No pressure from external forces. 

I will do a timebox every day. Writing whatever I feel like. The result I hope is that I improve my writing and my programming skills. 

Just doing easy things over a period of time will make much improvement over the years.
