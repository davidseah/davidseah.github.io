Continuing from my last post about my strategy and what I have learned from reading common clog articles. I think that there are two ways to learn something. When to use which method depends on what you are learning. 

The first one is perpetual exposure where you just expose yourself with many different sources, building neuro connects in your brain about a certain topic. This is especially useful for knowledge-based workers where our decision are based on what we understood and know. The more we know, the better we can make a decision. It is true that we are in an information age where information is abundance. But it is not good enough to be able to google a topic. Many times we are constraint by what we don't know that we don't know. The  quality of a decision is then to gather as much data as you can and make the best decision out of it. This is impossible without first knowing that the information is out there. So a strategy to be better will be to learn and expose yourself to as much information as possible. 

Deliberate practise is useful only for a set of activities that has a tradition of knowledge being passed down from coach to coach. Activities such as piano or basketball. It is hard to come out with deliberate practise yourself. It takes a generation of added knowledge to be able to do it effectively. 

I will say that it is more important to spend time doing perpetual exposure and be very careful about what you are deliberately practising. Put more thoughts into it and see if you are able to get quick feedback. 

So going forward, I will try to do 80% perpetual exposure which involves reading, watching a video, online tutorial and talking to people. I will also put more thoughts into deliberate practice, aiming for short projects to master specific techniques and get fast feedback.
