In one of my previous post, I mentioned some techniques that I have thought of for learning. But I thought about another use case where I need to learn something in other for me to complete a task at work. I call this the Just In Time Learning, In short JITL.

JITL has to be a focus session. Instead of looking at every single leaf along the way, cut the chase and go directly to your target as fast as possible. You have to focus and only learn things that are necessary for you to complete your work. Don't try to understand every single thing which I have a tendency to try to do that. Instead, leave the details for your planned studies.
