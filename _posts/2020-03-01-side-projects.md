I have been thinking of doing a couple of side projects. One of them is building a game. Even though I studied making games, I am not really good at making games. So far I have not make a full game all by myself. I was involved in parts of it, mostly building the engine. So I always wanted to make a game fully by myself. 

There are many ways of making a game. You can either build your own engine or use a commercial engine like Unity. After thinking through I decided to use SFML, a light 2D game engine. The reason is that I want to improve my C++ coding skill. To be able to able the different data structure and algorithm in C++ which I use it daily in my work. The cons of using SFML is that it will be able to port it easily to mobile devices. I think at some point of time I might change it to Unity but for now, I will focus on SFML. 

I think making games is cool, you get to not just apply your technical skills but also artistic skills. But this is a way too overcrowding field. There are just too many people building games. However, I think there is a silver lining which is not to sell the game but the process of making a job. Documenting it like a Vlog. I always enjoy watching people filming down their development process, I think there are still not many contents currently. Maybe I will attempt to do similar things.
