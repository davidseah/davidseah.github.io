Hi! This is the first post on this blog. I will be writing mainly about C++, OpenGL, and computer graphics. 
I have interest in web technologies too and is currently some time to learn them.  Also maybe a little of software engineering. 
The motivation is to try to learn as much as I can going deeper into a topic. I hope that one day I can be a world-class expert on these topics.
