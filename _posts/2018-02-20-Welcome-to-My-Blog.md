I have learned and used C/C++ for a good 7 years already. However, I feel that what I knew is only the tip of the iceberg.
For sure, I can do most of the things I wanted to at work but somehow I felt that there is so much more to learn. 
Especially with the introduction of modern C++. I thought maybe I should start a blog writing about C++. 
This way I can learn and also share my experiences.

But what should I write?

I see myself as an advanced beginner. This means that I am not going to pretend that I know everything. 
I am going to start from the basic and through time I will grow as I learn and eventually writing more complicated topics. 

There are so many blogs, articles, and video about c++ especially with the introduction of modern C++. 
I also want to bring values to my readers. So I asked asking what kind of values I can bring that is already not in the market?
What are people using C++ for?
What is lacking in their daily usage?

I think most people that use C++ uses it for its efficiency. 
So performance is a very important element. C++ developers are obsessed with what is the most optimized way to write code. 

Also while writing efficient codes are important, I believe most people will be pissed off read optimized code that is almost impossible to read without stopping and thinking about what the code actually does. 
I believe that code should be easily understood, that user should be able to know what the author intends at once glance. 
Of course usually with optimize code, the readability is compromised. 

I hope that in this blog I am able to cover a balance between this two aspect.
