Recently I have read an article about how to be an expert in everything. The article mentioned about the different stages of learning. For me, I am more interested in just getting from zero to a semi-expert. 
# Zero
The first stage of learning. You know nothing. You do not have any context to what you are learning. At this stage, focus on gathering as many recipes as possible. Recipes from blogs, online tutorial, books, online videos. After gathering, try to organise them in ways that make the most sense. Try to sort them from most useful to least. 

## Novice
At this stage, you are simply following instructions. Clear and precise instruction telling you how to get from A to C. There will be a high chance you will be stuck. Therefore it is important to get recipes that give clear and simple instruction. During the novice stage, it is important to do as many recipes as possible.

## Semi Expert
By now you should have some context and experience with what you are doing. But to be an expert, you have to play around with recipes and come out with your own mantras and rules. Lastly, design your own recipes.
