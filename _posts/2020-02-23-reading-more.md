My last post I talked about perpetual exposure and one of the ways to do that is by reading. Unfortunately, I didn't find reading as enjoyable as I used too. I used to read a lot especially when I am travelling. I will find myself drawn into the world of the books. Somehow along the years, reading has become a drag. Maybe it is because of the invention of the smartphone where I can be constantly entertained. 

I need a strategy to read more. To find the joy of reading. One of the strategies that I have identified is to have no pressure of getting anything out of the reading. Just read for the fun of reading and trust that by reading more my brain will be exposed to the various ideas which I can form a conclusion after exposing to multiple books and ideas. 

Also, I am going to cut my consumption of smartphone. I am not going to find myself endlessly scrolling through my social media. Whenever I feel like I want to do it, I should read a book instead. 

Hopefully, I am able to read more books this year.
