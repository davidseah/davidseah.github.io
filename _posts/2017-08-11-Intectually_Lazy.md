There is a common saying that to be a good programmer you have to be lazy. However, do not confuse lazy with intellectual laziness. 

You can be "physically" hardworking, which means you put in the hours and stay on your desk longer than any of your peers but that doesn't mean that you are intellectually hardworking. 
You can be spending hours copying and pasting stuff when you could simply write a script and do it at half the time. Or instead of going deeper and investigate a bug, you change a line and compile it hoping that it works. 

As a good software engineer, you need to be intellectually hardworking. Going beyond the surface and deep deeper to find out what is actually happening in the system or framework. You need to know the root of any problem and understanding far deeper than what you actually work on. 

If you did on these, maybe you will find yourself saving more time in the long run, and actually able to do more stuff.
