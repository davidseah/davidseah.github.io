There is a common saying that to be a good programmer you have to be lazy. 
By that, it means that you should automate everything that can be possibly automatic. While that is fine, there is another type of laziness. Intellectual laziness. This means that on the surface you appear to be hardworking but actually, you are lazy intellectually. 

Instead of thinking through the code, going deeper and investigate what actually happens, you took the easy route and just change some code and compile it. And by some luck, it might actually work. But the problem might be a something bigger than it what it seems like it is. 

A good software engineer will look deeper into the code, investigate the system and learn the framework.
